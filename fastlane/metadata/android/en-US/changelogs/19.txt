* fix sync_tags.sh always deleting tags
   > the script was deleting and re-adding local tags even if they reference the same commit hash as the remote, this should only happen only if they don't match
* added checks for versionCode and versionName
   > post_tag.sh now compares the versionCode and versionName of the new tag and the last tag and if they're equal, it shows an error. this way,they should not be the same accross different tags
* fixed logic after changing timeouts selection
   > when the timeouts were changed while the timer is running, the prev. and next timeouts were not updated correctly, and therefore tapping the caffeinate button when the timer has elapsed more than the debounce period, it started the next (incorrect) timeout although it should've stopped
