* fix service termination on some chinese OEM devices
   > - some chinese OEM devices have aggressive battery optimizations which
   > - would kill the service when the overlay option is enabled and the
   > - application is swiped away from the recent apps list or after some time
   > - has passed, the fix is a litte bit crude for now. the app saves the last
   > - remaining timeout to the device's storage every one second and then when
   > - the service is killed, it retreives the last saved remaining timeout and
   > - then restarts the service.
   > - This may put a strain on the device's storage but can be avoided if the
   > - overlay is disabled while running on these devices
* bug fixes and code improvements
   >
* added configureable widget
   > the widget's background can now be configured to be on or off
* fix allow while locked not working as expected
   > fixed issue where the allow while locked toggle worked opposite to the intended behavior
* added show overlay option
   > - added an option to show or hide an overlay with the remaining timeout
   > - on the top right/left of the screen
   > - the overlay option may be required on some devices in order for the app to
   > - continue working in the background
   > - if the overlay option is enabled and the app is closed from the recents
   > - menu, the timeout will be cancelled (seems that this is a restriciton
   > - from android, if there is an overlay enabled and the app is closed,
   > - everything gets terminated)
